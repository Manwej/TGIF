            <p>
              Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
              transparency. In a free society, transparency is government's
              obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart
              of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at
              TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.

                Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how
                officials conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money
                must be readily available and easily understood. This
                transparency allows good and just governance. Transparency
                promotes accountability and provides information for citizens
                about what their Government is doing. We also believe that
                government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances
                the Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its
                decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and public
                officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
                knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively
                engaged in American government. TGIF works to disclose
                information in forms that the public can readily find and use.
                We solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest
                use to the public.

            <h2>History of Government Transparency</h2>
            <p>
              In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
              scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to
              the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
              attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of
              their intellectual project.

                The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can
                also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which
                then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting
                free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of
                the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes
                more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on
                the eighteenth-century public sphere. Influenced by
                Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and
                France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and
                requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the
                press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century,
                attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these
                measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
                politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among
                the latter. Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark
                of contemporary democratic practice and is often linked to the
                passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian
                countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information
                legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the
                eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of
                openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
                Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
                legislation in 1999). The United States passed its Freedom of
                Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information
                Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway
                in 1970.
